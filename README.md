#Angular and socket.io chat application
This amazing website was built with Angularjs, socket.io and n00by bootstrap
##Few things that users should be aware of
1. If you create a room then you will automatically become and operator of that particular room.
2. If an operator leaves the current chat room or choses 'return to lobby' and re-enters the same room, he will lose all his op privileges.

3. If an operator ops another user there's is nothing that can save you from that newly deopped user to deop the original op.
Be careful about who you op.
4. You can send private messages to yourself. That might be strange, but remember you can send e-mails to yourself.

5. In the private message window you are provided with a dropdown of active users on the chat. Choose one to send pm to.
it will be delivered.
